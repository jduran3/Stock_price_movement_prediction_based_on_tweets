# Stock price movement prediction based on tweets

According to a recent article in Yahoo Finance, “over the past month retail investors funneled an average of $1.51 billion each day into U.S. stocks, the highest amount ever recorded”. Social sentiment from retail investors can have a significant influence on stock price changes and we want to use this to predict stock price changes or movements.

The objectives of this project are to analyze social sentiment from tweets related to 3 stocks: Google (GOOGL), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and JPChase Morgan (JPM) -- and build a predictive model to determine if the stock prices will go up or down in the next market open (9:30am ET).

The analysis and predictive model was based on tweets from market close (4:00 pm ET) to next day market open (9:30 am ET). The predictions from the model can be used to sell stocks on pre-market hours or at market opening.
